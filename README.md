# A1C - ArmA 1 Cutscene Animations
This mod for ArmA 3 adds Marian Quandt from ArmA 1 and all animations used in ArmA 1's cutscenes.  
You can find Marian under "Civilians > Others > Men".  

Please note: Marian is NOT A FUNCTIONAL NPC, since she uses a different skeleton! 
She is only intended to work with HER animations.  

There are animations for other characters, these do NOT work on Marian, but they DO work on everyone else.

I do NOT intend to port any other characters (like the news anchor) since they can be reasonably replaced by existing ArmA 3 or CUP models.
Marian is unique because she is a woman.

### TODO
Currently, the files are in the \ca\ namespace. I will move them to \CAPS_A1C\ soon, to prevent possible file conflicts with other mods.
